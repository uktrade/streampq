# streampq [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/uktrade/streampq.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/uktrade/streampq) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/d96c6b7b6f8cf6ecfd9c/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/uktrade/streampq/test_coverage)

Stream results of multi-statement PostgreSQL queries from Python without server-side cursors. Has benefits over some other Python PostgreSQL libraries:

- Streams results from complex multi-statement queries even though SQL doesn't allow server-side cursors for such queries - suitable for large amounts of results that don't fit in memory.

- CTRL+C (SIGINT) by default behaves as expected even during slow queries - a `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised and quickly bubbles up through streampq code. Unless client code prevents it, the program will exit.

- Every effort is made to cancel queries on `KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`, or errors - the server doesn't continue needlessly using resources.

Particularly useful when temporary tables are needed to store intermediate results in multi-statement SQL scripts.


## Installation

```bash
pip install streampq
```

The `libpq` binary library is also required. This is typically either already installed, or installed by: 

- macOS + brew: `brew install libpq`
- Linux (Debian): `apt install libpq5`
- Linux (Red Hat):`yum install postgresql-libs`

The only runtime dependencies are `libpq` and Python itself.


## Usage

```python
from streampq import streampq_connect

# libpq connection paramters
# https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS
#
# Any can be ommitted and environment variables will be used instead
# https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html
connection_params = (
    ('host', 'localhost'),
    ('port', '5432'),
    ('dbname', 'postgres'),
    ('user', 'postgres'),
    ('password', 'password'),
)

# SQL statement(s) - if more than one, separate by ;
sql = '''
    SELECT * FROM my_table;
    SELECT * FROM my_other_table;
'''

# Connection and querying is via a context manager
with streampq_connect(connection_params) as query:
    for (columns, rows) in query(sql):
        print(columns)  # Tuple of column names
        for row in rows:
            print(row)  # Tuple of row  values
```

### Chunked Pandas dataframes of SQL query results

You can create chunked Pandas dataframes of SQL query results, similar to the output of using the `chunksize` parameter of the Pandas `read_csv` function. This uses a helper function to do the chunking.

```python
import itertools
import pandas as pd
from streampq import streampq_connect

connection_params = (
    ('host', 'localhost'),
    ('port', '5432'),
    ('dbname', 'postgres'),
    ('user', 'postgres'),
    ('password', 'password'),
)

sql = '''
    SELECT * FROM my_table;
    SELECT * FROM my_other_table;
'''

def query_chunked_dfs(query, sql, chunk_size):

    def _chunked_df(columns, rows):
        it = iter(rows)
        while True:
            df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(itertools.islice(it, chunk_size), columns=columns)
            if len(df) == 0:
                break
            yield df

    for columns, rows in query(sql):
        yield _chunked_df(columns, rows)

with streampq_connect(connection_params) as query:
    for chunked_dfs in query_chunked_dfs(query, sql, chunk_size=10000):
        for df in chunked_dfs:
            print(df)
```

### PostgreSQL types to Python type decoding

There are [164 built-in PostgreSQL data types (including array types)](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/include/catalog/pg_type.dat), and streampq converts them to Python types. In summary:

| PostgreSQL types                                       | Python type                                            |
|:-------------------------------------------------------| :------------------------------------------------------|
| null                                                   | None                                                   |
| text (e.g. varchar), xml, network addresses, and money | str                                                    |
| byte (e.g. bytea)                                      | bytes                                                  |
| integer (e.g. int4)                                    | int                                                    |
| inexact real number (e.g. float4)                      | float                                                  |
| exact real number (e.g. numeric)                       | Decimal                                                |
| date                                                   | date                                                   |
| timestamp                                              | datetime (without timezone)                            |
| timestamptz                                            | datetime (with offset timezone)                        |
| json and jsonb                                         | output of json.loads                                   |
| interval                                               | [streampq.Interval](#streampqinterval)                 |
| range (e.g. daterange)                                 | [streampq.Range](#streampqrange)                       |
| multirange (e.g. datemultirange)                       | tuples of [streampq.Range](#streampqrange)             |
| arrays and vectors                                     | tuple (of any of the above types, or of nested tuples) |

To customise these, override the default value of the `get_decoders` parameter of the `streampq_connect` function in [streampq.py](./streampq.py).

In general, built-in types are preferred over custom types, and immutable types are preferred over mutable.

#### streampq.Interval

The Python built-in timedelta type is not used for PostgreSQL interval since timedelta does not offer a way to store PostgreSQL intervals of years or months, other than converting to days which would be a loss of information.

Instead, a [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) is defined, streampq.Interval, with members:

| Member  | Type    |
|:--------|:--------|
| years   | int     |
| months  | int     |
| days    | int     |
| hours   | int     |
| minutes | int     |
| seconds | Decimal |


#### streampq.Range

There is no Python built-in type for a PosgreSQL range. So for these, a [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) is defined, streampq.Range, with members:

| Member  | Type                                                                       |
|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| lower   | int, date, datetime (without timezone), or datetime (with offset timezone) |
| upper   | int, date, datetime (without timezone), or datetime (with offset timezone) |
| bounds  | str - one of `()`, `(]`, `[)`, or `[]`                                     |


### Bind parameters - literals

Dynamic SQL literals can be bound using the `literals` parameter of the query function. It must be an iterable of key-value pairs.

```python
sql = '''
    SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_col = {my_col_value};
'''

with streampq_connect(connection_params) as query:
    for (columns, rows) in query(sql, literals=(
        ('my_col_value', 'my-value'),
    )):
        for row in rows:
            pass
```


### Bind parameters - identifiers

Dynamic SQL identifiers, e.g. column names, can be bound using the `identifiers` parameter of the query function. It must be an iterable of key-value pairs.

```python
sql = '''
    SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE {column_name} = 'my-value';
'''

with streampq_connect(connection_params) as query:
    for (columns, rows) in query(sql, identifiers=(
        ('column_name', 'my_col'),
    )):
        for row in rows:
            pass
```

Identifiers and literals use different escaping rules - hence the need for 2 different parameters.


### Single-statement SQL queries

While this library is specialsed for multi-statement queries, it works fine when there is only one. In this case the iterable returned from the query function yields only a single `(columns, rows)` pair.


## Exceptions

Exceptions derive from `streampq.StreamPQError`. If there is any more information available on the error, it's added as a string in its `args` property. This is included in the string representation of the exception by default.


## Exception hierarchy

  - **StreamPQError**

    Base class for all explicitly-thrown exceptions

    - **ConnectionError**

      An error occurred while attempting to connect to the database.

    - **QueryError**

      An error occurred while attempting to run a query. Typically this is due to a syntax error or a missing column.

    - **CancelError**

      An error occurred while attempting to cancel a query.

    - **CommunicationError**

      An error occurred communicating with the database after successful connection.
